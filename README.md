1. Audience Expertise Level: Understanding whether you're writing for tech experts or regular users helps you decide how deep to go. Experts expect detailed, technical content; beginners need simplified explanations and step-by-step guidance.

2. Tailoring Content:  Use language and examples your audience relates to. For non-tech users, avoid acronyms and provide analogies. For experts, focus on precision and include technical terms or code snippets.

3. Gauging Existing Knowledge: Use surveys, user feedback, or analytics to assess what your audience already knows. Reviewing forums or FAQs can also reveal common knowledge gaps.

4. Ensuring Accessibility:  Break content into digestible parts, define unfamiliar terms, and provide context. Use short sentences, bullets, and summaries to help less technical readers.

5. Importance of Plain Language:  Plain language ensures clarity. It reduces misunderstandings and makes your content more inclusive and usable, especially for non-native speakers.

6. Simplifying Terms – Example:  Using “start” instead of “initiate” or “fix” instead of “resolve” makes your content more relatable and quicker to understand, improving reader confidence and speed.

7. Using Examples and Visuals:  Examples make abstract concepts real. Visuals like flowcharts or screenshots can simplify complex processes, especially for visual learners.

8. Types of Visuals:  
- Flowcharts: Great for processes  
- Diagrams: Helpful for system architecture  
- Screenshots: Best for UI guidance  
- Graphs/Charts: Ideal for data comparison

9. Role of Headings/Subheadings:  They guide the reader, break up content, and make scanning easier. This structure improves comprehension and helps users find what they need quickly.

10. Best Practices for Headings:  Be descriptive but concise. Use a consistent style, make them specific, and follow a logical hierarchy (e.g., H1 for titles, H2 for sections).

11. README Introduction:  Start with a one-line description of what the product does, who it’s for, and the main problem it solves. This gives users immediate context.

12. Conveying Purpose and Features:  Use a short paragraph or bullet list. Focus on user benefits—what the tool does, how it's useful, and key functions—without diving into technical details too soon.
